## Printf project

This is a collaborative ALX printf  project done by Ronny Munene and Joyliz

This project is a C implementation that replicates the functionality of the printf function. It allows users to write output to the standard output stream (stdout) using a character string as a format.

The printf function takes a format string as its first argument, followed by additional arguments of various types. This project supports all the standard format specifiers, such as %s, %d, and %x, and also includes flags and width modifiers.

To achieve this, the printf function internally utilizes the write, malloc, free, va_start, va_end, va_copy, and va_arg functions and macros, as described in the man pages.

This project serves as a valuable resource for anyone aiming to comprehend the behavior of the standard printf function in C, or for those interested in implementing their own version of printf.
